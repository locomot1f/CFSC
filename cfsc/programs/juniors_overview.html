<div class="title">What is the Juniors Academy Program?</div>

<div class="para">
    <span style="font-weight: 600;">The Cleveland Force SC Juniors Academy</span> is a year round program designed for young players that are beginning to show a great love for the game, and those families looking for a challenging environment, with more advanced coaching. The program is comprised of male and female athletes between 5 — 8 years of age.
</div>

<div class="para">
    <span style="font-weight: 600;">The Program's primary objective</span> is to maximize the development of every child in each of the four elements of the game in a FUN & SAFE environment!
</div>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlights">Technical</span> - ball manipulation</li>
        <li><span class="highlights">Physical/ Mobility</span> - coordination, balance</li>
        <li><span class="highlights">Mental</span> - decision making, spacial recognition</li>
        <li><span class="highlights">Tactical</span> - teamwork</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="para">
    This is done by using progressive methods of training to introduce new ideas and information in a manner that is easy to understand and apply by our youngest players.
    </div>
    <div class="para">
    Furthermore, <span style="font-weight: 600;">this program is an introduction to the Cleveland Force Soccer Club</span> and opportunities to prepare players to advance into the full competitive program starting at U9. The Juniors program starts in mid-September and finishes in late-May with breaks for holidays and time off from school.
