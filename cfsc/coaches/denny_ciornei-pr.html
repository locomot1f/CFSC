            "Denny is a one-of-a-kind coach. His ability to break the game down and teach each individual skills is unparalleled. He sees the game  differently which gives him the ability to develop players in a unique, unorthodox way that always gets results. I have been with Denny  for over 12 years now, and he took me as a freshman in college and has been with me every step of the way to today, my 9th season as a   professional player." - <span class="quote">Austin FC, Brad Stuver</span>

        <div class="testimonial">
            “Denny Ciornei and the Ciornei Goalkeeping Academy’s methods quite simply built the foundation from which I was able to launch a professional goalkeeping career. His breakdown of the position tactically, psychologically, and physically is second to none and crucial for the development of young goalkeepers. Working with him changed my life.” - <span class="quote">Leeds United, Charlie Horton</span>

            “I started working with Denny when I was 10 years old, and he built me into a professional from the ground up. His knowledge of the game and goalkeeping itself is unparalleled, but it’s his ability to instill confidence in his goalkeepers that truly sets Denny apart.” - <span class="quote">Minnesota United, Alec Ferrell</span>
