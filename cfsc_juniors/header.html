The program is comprised of male and female athletes between 5 — 8 years of age.

    <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#194077;">The Program's primary objective</span> is to maximize the development of every child in each of the four elements of the game in a FUN & SAFE environment!

    Furthermore, <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#194077;">this program is an introduction to the Cleveland Force Soccer Club</span> and opportunities to prepare players to advance into the full competitive program starting at U9. The Juniors program starts in mid-September and finishes in late-May with breaks for holidays and time off from school. Players can attend **training options in two convenient geographical locations:** Central (near east) and West.

    Several **Inter-squad "friendlies"** will be scheduled at the various locations for each player to experience game speed and apply their fundamental skills from the program.
